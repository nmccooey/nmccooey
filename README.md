### Airline Pilot to Software Engineer
I began making Android apps in 2015 and have thousands of downloads in the Google Play Store. In 2018, I became a flight instructor and taught people how to fly small airplanes. I later became an Airline Pilot flying United Airlines E-145 jets. After COVID-19, I got deep into web development and returned to school. I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island. My goal is to become part of a team and contribute to the development of something amazing.

### Full Stack Development
Most of my experiences has been in full stack development. My major projects are built with the PERN (Postgres, Express, React, Node) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stacks. I also have advanced experience with React including the usage of Redux and Context API.
