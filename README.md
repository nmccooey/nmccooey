### Airline Pilot to Software Engineer
In 2015, while a computer science student, I became interested in Android development. While learning Android development I created multiple apps that have gathered thousands of downloads on the Google Play Store. Nearing the end of my degree in 2018, I decided to take a leap and pursue my dream of becoming a pilot. After a year of flight instructing I got a job as an airline pilot flying United Airlines E-145 jets. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the airline industry hard, and like many pilots I was laid off. Never one to miss a beat I dove deep into web development and returned to school to finish my degree. I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island in winter 2020. My goal is to find a team where I can leverage the attention to detail I learned while becoming an airline pilot, and hone my skills as an engineer, all while making a positive impact.

### Full Stack Development
Most of my experience has been in full stack development. My major projects are built with the PERN (Postgres, Express, React, Node) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stacks. I also have advanced experience with React, including the usage of Redux and Context API.

### Computer Science
I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island. My undergraduate studies have included:
* Object Orientated Programming
  * Python, Java, JavaScript
* Database Design and Management
  * Modeling, Design Theory, Relational (SQL) and Non-relational Databases (NoSQL)
* Algorithms
